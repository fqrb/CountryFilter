# Country Filter

Very simple Tampermonkey script that adds a Filter By Netherlands button to the leaderboard page of [ScoreSaber.com](https://scoresaber.com/)

# Getting Started

Get Tampermonkey for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/). Then install the script from [here](https://github.com/fqrb/CountryFilter/raw/main/main.user.js).

# Usage

Once it works, whenever you load a leaderboard page that is not already filtered by NL it should automatically add a button that will filter by the Netherlands on the right side.
